Which type of fund must be listed on the stock exchange?
a. Sector funds.
b. Arbitrage funds.
c. Close-ended funds.
d. Liquid funds.

True or false: open-ended schemes typically provide investors with an exit option through a stock exchange.
a. True.
b. False.

True or false: sector funds invest in a variety of different sectors.
a. False.
b. True.

True or false: high yield bond schemes invest in junk bonds.
a. True.
b. False.

An investment objective is closely related to what?
a. Scheme.
b. Option.
c. Plan.
d. SI.

Sure, here are more precise explanations for each answer:

Close-ended funds are traded like shares on the stock exchange and can only be bought or sold on the exchange. Therefore, they must be listed on the stock exchange. Sector funds, arbitrage funds, and liquid funds can be either open-ended or close-ended and may or may not be listed on the stock exchange depending on their structure and investment strategy.

Open-ended schemes do not typically provide investors with an exit option through a stock exchange. Instead, investors can redeem their units directly with the fund house at the prevailing net asset value (NAV) per unit.

Sector funds are designed to invest in a specific sector or industry, such as technology, healthcare, or energy. They do not invest in a variety of different sectors, unlike diversified equity funds or index funds.

High yield bond schemes, also known as junk bond funds, invest in lower-rated or riskier corporate bonds that offer higher yields than investment-grade bonds. These bonds are considered riskier because the issuers have a higher likelihood of defaulting on their debt.

An investment objective is a statement that describes the primary goal or purpose of a particular mutual fund or other investment product. It typically includes the target asset class, investment strategy, and expected return. The investment objective is closely related to the scheme because it describes the structure and objective of the mutual fund or other investment product.

What percentage of equity would be appropriate to suggest for a young, unmarried individual who is financially stable?
a. 100 percent.
b. 80 percent.
c. 60 percent.
d. 40 percent.

The correct option is a. Through risk profilers. Risk profilers are commonly used tools to assess an investor's risk tolerance, which helps in determining the suitable investment products and asset allocation.

True. The goal of asset allocation is to manage risk by diversifying the investment portfolio across different asset classes, such as stocks, bonds, and cash equivalents. The objective is to optimize the portfolio's risk-reward tradeoff and achieve the investor's financial goals.

The correct option is a. Strategic Asset Allocation. Strategic asset allocation is a long-term approach to asset allocation that is determined based on an investor's risk profiling. It involves selecting a target allocation of different asset classes and maintaining it over time through periodic rebalancing.

The appropriate percentage of equity for a young, unmarried individual who is financially stable depends on their risk profile and investment goals. However, as a general guideline, a higher allocation to equity may be suitable for a young investor who has a longer investment horizon and a higher risk tolerance. Therefore, the option b. 80 percent could be appropriate, but it is essential to consider the individual's risk profile and investment goals before making any specific recommendations.

The correct option is d. Trustees. The assets of a mutual fund are held by an independent entity called the trustee, who is responsible for ensuring that the mutual fund operates in the best interest of the investors.

The minimum net worth requirement for a new AMC is Rs 50 crore, as per the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) regulations.

True. The appointment of AMC directors requires the approval of the Trustees, who represent the interests of the mutual fund investors.

The most investor service centers are offices of the Registrar, which is responsible for maintaining the records of the mutual fund unit holders and processing transactions related to buying, selling, and transferring mutual fund units.

It depends on the mutual fund's size and complexity. Small and medium-sized mutual funds may choose to manage their fund accounting activity in-house, while larger and more complex mutual funds may outsource this activity to specialized service providers. Therefore, the answer is b. False, as outsourcing the fund accounting activity is not mandatory.

False. The investment objective defines the specific investment goals and constraints for a mutual fund scheme, such as the asset classes and sectors the scheme will invest in, the investment horizon, and the risk-return profile. The broad investment charter is defined by the fund house and the fund's investment management team.

The Statement of Account is required to be sent to investors within five business days of the NFO (New Fund Offer) closure. This document provides the details of the investor's investment in the mutual fund scheme.

Warrants for dividend payment are required to be sent to investors within 30 days of the dividend declaration date.

True. Investors can hold their mutual fund units in dematerialized (demat) form, which offers several advantages such as easier and faster transactions, lower costs, and greater convenience.

NFOs (New Fund Offers) other than ELSS (Equity Linked Saving Schemes) can be open for a maximum of 15 days, as per SEBI regulations. ELSS funds have a lock-in period of three years, and hence, their NFOs can be open for up to 30 days.

True. Offer documents of mutual fund schemes, including the SID, SAI, and KIM (Key Information Memorandum), need to be approved by SEBI before they can be used for the offer of the scheme.

The application form for a mutual fund scheme is attached to the SID (Scheme Information Document).

False. The KIM (Key Information Memorandum) is not required to be updated every six months. However, any material changes in the information provided in the KIM need to be updated and communicated to investors.

As per SEBI regulations, the maximum initial commission that a mutual fund scheme can pay to distributors is 1 percent of the amount invested. However, mutual funds are also required to follow a trail commission model, where a percentage of the assets under management (AUM) is paid as commission to the distributor every year, as long as the investor continues to hold the units.

True - Equity markets are generally considered more predictable in the long term than in the short term. The volatility in the short term can be attributed to various factors such as news, events, and emotions, whereas in the long term, the performance of the stock market tends to follow the growth of the economy.

True - Arbitrage funds are designed to provide lower-risk exposure to equity markets. They take advantage of the price differences between the cash and derivatives market of the same asset, which tends to be more stable than the price movements in the equity markets.

True - Liquid funds are mutual fund schemes that invest in highly liquid money market instruments, and their comparable is a savings bank account. Liquid funds provide higher returns than a savings account and are highly liquid, making them an ideal parking place for idle money.

True - Fundamental analysis involves evaluating the strength of a company's financial statements, such as its income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement, to determine its intrinsic value and growth potential. Price-volume charts are part of technical analysis, which is a different approach to evaluating investments based on historical price and volume data.

The investment manager first evaluates macroeconomic trends and identifies sectors that are likely to perform well. Then, they select stocks within those sectors based on their financial strength and valuation.

True - Gold is considered a truly international asset class because it is traded in global markets, and its price is influenced by global economic and geopolitical factors. Investors around the world use gold as a store of value and a hedge against inflation and currency fluctuations.

True - Loads and taxes can have an impact on the difference between scheme returns and investor returns. Loads are charges that mutual fund houses levy on investors for buying or selling units of a mutual fund scheme, and taxes are levied on the returns generated by the scheme. These charges reduce the investor's returns from the scheme.

True - The most appropriate way to measure returns for a mutual fund that has been in existence for several years is by calculating its compound annual growth rate (CAGR).
